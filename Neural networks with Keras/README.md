# Advanced TensorFlow Techniques

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating advanced techniques in TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning. The project is divided into two main parts: Data Augmentation & Regularization, and Advanced Keras Techniques.

## Part 1: Data Augmentation and Regularization

This part explores various data augmentation methods and regularization techniques to improve model performance and generalization.

### Colab Notebooks:

- **data_augmentation_techniques**: Illustrates different data augmentation techniques for image, video, text, time series, tabular data, and speech.

- **advanced_data_augmentation.ipynb**: Uses libraries like AugLy and keras_cv to demonstrate state-of-the-art data augmentation.

## Part 2: Advanced Keras Techniques

This part covers advanced constructs and custom implementations in Keras, enhancing flexibility and capability of models.

### Notebooks

- **custom_components.ipynb**: Demonstrates the creation and usage of custom layers, models, loss functions, metrics, and more.
- **custom_training_loop.ipynb**: Shows how to build a custom training loop to have precise control over the training process.
