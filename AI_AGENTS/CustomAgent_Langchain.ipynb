Applying a warm compress, gentle massage, and possibly physical therapy can aid recovery if the sprain is severe. Preventative measures include strengthening ... Sprains happen when a ligament is torn or damaged, usually when one of your joints moves further than it should. Muscle strains happen when one of your muscles is torn. People also sometimes call strains pulled muscles or muscle tears. Providers sometimes call tendon tears strains. Sprains and strains are both common sports injuries. Avoid any activity that causes pain in the ankle. Rest your ankle, and minimize walking for the rest of the day. Ice. Apply ice to the sore part of your ankle, typically for 15 minutes on and then 15 minutes off, as much as possible for the rest of the day. Continue with 15 minutes of icing three times a day until the pain and swelling subside. Even if your ankle sprain seems minor, you should still take it seriously. Proper care after a sprained ankle can help speed up healing and reduce the risk of re-injuring yourself. To get back on your feet the safe way, try following the acronym R.I.C.E. to treat your sprained ankle: rest, ice, compress, and elevate. For sprain treatment at home, many experts now recommend a variation of RICE known as the POLICE method. You can observe the POLICE method with these steps: Protect: For at least 24 hours after a sprain, it's important to protect the muscle by limiting its use. This allows scar tissue to form a bridge between the torn strands of muscle fibers.\""

Starship is intended to be fully reusable, allowing both stages to be recovered after a mission and to be rapidly reused. SpaceX has stated that a long-term goal for the Starship system is to achieve frequent space launches at low cost. Development follows an iterative and incremental approach, involving often destructive test flights of prototype vehicles.The Starship launch vehicle is designed to supplant SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, expand SpaceX's Starlink satellite constellation, and launch crews to both low Earth orbit and Mars. The vehicle is fundamental to SpaceX's ambition of colonizing Mars. SpaceX plans to use Starship vehicles as tankers, refueling other Starships to allow missions to geosynchronous orbit, the Moon, and Mars. A planned lunar lander variant of Starship was contracted by NASA to land astronauts on the Moon as part of the Artemis program for at least two Artemis lunar landings, starting with Artemis 3 in 2026.Starship consists of the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft. Both stages are powered by Raptor engines, which burn liquid methane and liquid oxygen. Both stages are constructed primarily of stainless steel, instead of the carbon composite used in a series of prior designs. The booster is designed to use its engines to slow itself down, before being caught by a pair of mechanical arms attached to the launch tower. The Starship spacecraft is designed to be protected during atmospheric reentry by its thermal protection system, and it is able to land using its engines, following a 'belly flop' maneuver, where the spacecraft turns from a horizontal to a vertical orientation.\n",
            "The first flight test of the full Starship system took place on 20 April 2023, lifting-off with three engines out and ending four minutes after launch due to a loss of control, resulting in the destruction of the launch vehicle. The second flight test of the vehicle took place on 18 November 2023, achieving stage separation with the Super Heavy booster exploding roughly 30 seconds later following multiple engine failures during its boostback burn.

            "Summary: As of 2023, SpaceX operates four launch facilities: Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40), Vandenberg Space Force Base Space Launch Complex 4E (SLC-4E), Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A), and Brownsville South Texas Launch Site (Starbase). Space Launch Complex 40 was damaged in the AMOS-6 accident in September 2016 and repair work was completed by December 2017. SpaceX believes that they can optimize their launch operations, and reduce launch costs, by dividing their launch missions amongst these four launch facilities: LC-39A for NASA launches, SLC-40 for United States Space Force national security launches, SLC-4E for polar launches, and South Texas Launch Site for commercial launches.COO Gwynne Shotwell stated in 2014 that \"we are expanding in all of our locations\" and \"you will end up seeing a lot of SpaceX launch sites in order to meet the future demand that we anticipate.\" As of June 2016, SpaceX discussed preliminary plans to launch an average of 90 rockets per year after 2019. SpaceX have indicated that, depending on market demand, they may actually need another commercial launch site in addition to the Texas location.In 2016, SpaceX signed a five-year lease to use a 53,000 square foot (4,900 m2) former Spacehab building at Port Canaveral. A new building nearby is also planned, and these facilities would be used to refurbish rockets.In addition, SpaceX uses a suborbital test facility, the SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas. A high-altitude suborbital test facility was under construction in New Mexico, but was abandoned following the switch to flight tests on commercial missions.\n",
            "SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities currently in use or under construction, and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad, particularly so by the end of the decade if SpaceX business remains strong.\n",

            "Summary: Starbase is an industrial complex for Starship rockets, located at Boca Chica, Texas, United States. It has been under construction since the late 2010s by SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer. Starbase is composed of a spaceport near the Gulf of Mexico, a production facility at the Boca Chica village, and a small structure test site along the Texas State Highway 4.\n",
            "When conceptualized, its stated purpose was \"to provide SpaceX an exclusive launch site that would allow the company to accommodate its launch manifest and meet tight launch windows.\" The launch site was originally intended to support launches of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles as well as \"a variety of reusable suborbital launch vehicles\", but in early 2018, SpaceX announced a change of plans, stating that the launch site would be used exclusively for SpaceX's next-generation launch vehicle, Starship. Between 2018 and 2020, the site added significant rocket production and test capacity.  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk indicated in 2014 that he expected \"commercial astronauts, private astronauts, to be departing from South Texas,\" and eventually launching spacecraft to Mars from the site.Between 2012 and 2014, SpaceX considered seven potential locations around the United States for the new commercial launch facility.  Generally, for orbital launches an ideal site would have an easterly water overflight path for safety and be located as close to the equator as possible in order to take advantage of the Earth's rotational speed. For much of this period, a parcel of land adjacent to Boca Chica Beach near Brownsville, Texas, was the leading candidate location, during an extended period while the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted an extensive environmental assessment on the use of the Texas location as a launch site.  Also during this period, SpaceX began acquiring land in the area, purchasing approximately 41 acres (170,000 m2) and leasing 57 acres (230,000 m2) by July 2014. SpaceX annou\u001b[0m\n",

            "Summary: Education in Japan is managed by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan. Education is compulsory at the elementary and lower secondary levels. Most students attend public schools through the lower secondary level, but private education is popular at the upper secondary and university levels. Education prior to elementary school is provided at kindergartens and day-care centres. The programmes for those children aged 3–5 resemble those at kindergartens. The educational approach at kindergartens varies greatly from unstructured environments that emphasize play to highly structured environments that are focused on having the child pass the entrance exam at a private elementary school. The academic year starts from April and ends in March, having summer vacation in August and winter vacation in the end of December to the beginning of January.\n",
            "Japanese students consistently rank highly among OECD students in terms of quality and performance in reading, mathematics, and sciences. Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences on Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests with the average student scoring 520, compared with the OECD average of 488, placing it eighth in the world in the 2018 ranking. The contemporary Japanese population is highly educated, steeped in a traditional cultural ethos influenced by Confucian values dating back over two millennia in a civilization whose national strength was dependent on an educated populace coupled with a deeply ingrained societal quintessence that has long acknowledged the fundamental importance of education as a central means to propel scientific advancement and cultural progress. Japanese culture and society has traditionally placed an enormously important emphasis on education as a means of advancing in both socioeconomic standing and securing promising employment prospects within the nation's advanced technologically driven economy, both historically and in modern times. The nation's fulsome pool of highly educated and skilled individuals has played a pivotal role in facilitating the economic transformation of the island archipelago in the aftermath of the Second World War. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering, benefit socioeconomically from their extensive breadth and depth of scientific knowledge and technical skillsets when navigating the country's high technology-oriented economy.Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is 4.1 percent, which is below the OECD average of 5 percent. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small. In 2020, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25-to-64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 52.7 percent. In 2023, approximately 65% of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have achieved some form of tertiary educational qualification, with bachelor's degrees are held by 34.2% of the Japanese populace aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea. Japanese females are more highly educated compared to their male counterparts as 59 percent of Japanese women possess a university degree, compared to 52 percent of Japanese men. As the Japanese economy is largely scientifically and technologically based, its labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. According to the MEXT, the percentage of Japanese going on to any higher education institution in the eighteen-year-old cohort was 80.6 percent, with 52.6 percent of students going on to a university, 4.7 percent to a junior college, 0.9 percent to a college of technology and the remaining 22.4 percent attending a correspondence school, the University of the Air or a special\u001b[0m\n",
